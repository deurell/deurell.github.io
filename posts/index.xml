      <description>The iPad is an amazing learning device. You can read shader books on it. Draw shader ideas on it. And ever since iOS playgrounds got a major boost you can even develop Metal shaders on it using Playgrounds.
It was the only device I had with me on my easter vacation in the woods. Most of the time was spent like this:
But you need to catch your breath every once in a while and what could possibly be better than coding shaders on the iPad, in the hammock?</description>

      <title>Recreating Beat Saber lazers with unicorns</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding professionally for over 20 years and I still learn new things every single day. One of the most fun and rewarding ways I use to get better is to recreate things in games I love. And I&amp;rsquo;m in love with so many games. It never ends. An endless, lovely, gamedev tutorial!
One of the games I love is Beat Saber. I wanted to recreate it as a VR learning experience on my HTC Vive.</description>

      <title>Setting up ShaderModifiers in SceneKit</title>

      <description>I &amp;lt;3 the Metal shader debugger in XCode. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve been sent from the future. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing shaders in OpenGL for years and years. The last five years I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping a nice Swedish game company to code casual games with a lot of Candy. And Crushes. More than once I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that the demos and shaders I did for fun in my teens are the very things that&amp;rsquo;s putting food on the table for my kids over 100 years later.</description>

      <title>Teaching your teen to code a starfield in PICO-8</title>

      <description>Kids love starfields. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect coding session with a nice visual result and basic highschool math. We&amp;rsquo;re going to build this:
When coding with kids, always keep it simple and at their level. I know most of you reading this are math wizards but kids tend not to be super impressed by your vector math and matrix calculations (believe me, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried). You&amp;rsquo;re going for quick results and simple code, on their math level.</description>

      <description>Growing up I loved to play Crazy Comets on my C64. The magic starfield seemed almost impossible to code for a 14 year old and the music by Rob Hubbard totally blew me away. I decided to code a pico8 remake of it together with my 6 year old daughter in order to show her how to make games. We had a fantastic time!
Pico8 has the simplicity needed in order to show how everything fits together.</description>
