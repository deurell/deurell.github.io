      <description>The iPad is an amazing learning device. You can read shader books on it. Draw shader ideas on it. And ever since iOS playgrounds got a major boost you can even develop Metal shaders on it using Playgrounds.
It was the only device I had with me on my easter vacation in the woods. Most of the time was spent like this:
But you need to catch your breath every once in a while and what could possibly be better than coding shaders on the iPad, in the hammock?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding professionally for over 20 years and I still learn new things every single day. One of the most fun and rewarding ways I use to get better is to recreate things in games I love. And I&amp;rsquo;m in love with so many games. It never ends. An endless, lovely, gamedev tutorial!
One of the games I love is Beat Saber. I wanted to recreate it as a VR learning experience on my HTC Vive.</description>

      <title>Setting up ShaderModifiers in SceneKit</title>

      <description>I &amp;lt;3 the Metal shader debugger in XCode. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve been sent from the future. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing shaders in OpenGL for years and years. The last five years I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping a nice Swedish game company to code casual games with a lot of Candy. And Crushes. More than once I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that the demos and shaders I did for fun in my teens are the very things that&amp;rsquo;s putting food on the table for my kids over 100 years later.</description>
